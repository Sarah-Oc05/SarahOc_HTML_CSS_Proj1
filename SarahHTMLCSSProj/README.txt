Theme
A dark, slick, modern, responsive, adjective-drenched design built around an extremely
dynamic landing page (scroll that mofo!). Inspired by Big Picture, another design
of mine with a similarish feel/flow, only this time I took it waaaaaay further and
actually made it multipurpose (versus copping out and making it a one pager like I
did last time ;) Includes multiple pages, a bunch of pre-styled elements, and all
its Sass sources.

I was stuck in my head on how to bring my vision to life! But then I thought, why not look at templates and see which ones best fits!

I was able to find AJ aj@lkn.io | @ajlkn template from HTML5 UP, and used it as a reference. 

By doing this, I was reminder of MySpace, Tumblr and Square. Now learning what each term, function and buttons I'm able to create and upgrade my websites as I go. 

The Hero/landing page is based off a ref, but the coffee shop and timeline pages are from sctratch. 

Over time and learning more about HTML, CSS then hopefully react and Sass, I will be able to transform my portfolio as I go.
